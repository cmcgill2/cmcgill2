### Hi there I'm Chris! 👋

I love diving into novel problems, optimizing existing solutions, and on occasion, making code run really, really fast.

Some of my favorite languages:
Golang, Typescript, rust

Some problems I've worked on:
programmatic trading, infrastructure, video streaming, property management, billing, mortgage (rate locking)
