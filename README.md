### Hi there üëã

I love diving into novel problems, optimizing existing solutions, and on occasion, making code run really, really fast. I've found that if you choose the right tools, well-designed solutions can be rapid to implement and flexible to new demands.

Some of my favorite languages:
Typescript, Golang, Rust

Some problems I've worked on:
- Media: video streaming, livestream, global content delivery
- Property Management: billing, maintenance tracking, request in-home services
- Finance: mortgage
